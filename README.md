# GodotWebviewPluginForAndroid

This is a simple android plugin to be used in Godot (tested with 4.4) and allows for webview access. 

What it does:
- allow http and https website access
- save and load last played video
- default website set to youtube.com

  
What it doesn't: 
- specify trusted sites

Future plans:
- create an iOS plugin version (I don't own a mac and currently can't compile the plugin)
